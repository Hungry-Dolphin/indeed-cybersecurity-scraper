# indeed-cybersecurity-scraper 

This is a project where I (hopefully) create a dockerised web application to manage what certifications are asked for in cybersecurity jobs

# TODO
- Set up flask webserver to serve me a webserver on some port
- Write a function (most likely using selenium since indeed uses js to serve content) to scrape job postings
- Do some analysis on these job postings to see what certifications they ask for 
- Dockerise this application so I can run this on my home server without hassle


# TODO's later
- Don't just copy the entire workdir in the dockerfile
